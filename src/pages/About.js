          Metanoia is an upcoming EdTech startup that seeks to put
          social issues at the forefront of childrenâ€™s lives
          through our virtual interactive library. Our website
          bridges the communication gap between parents/teachers
          and students by tailoring personalized book
          recommendations that foster meaningful discussions. K-5
          students will be able to enrich their knowledge whenever
          and wherever they go!
